# CMarks

When attending lectures, conferences, or any event where audience members are learning new information, typically, audience members would like to review what they have learned. The CMarks web application gives audience members the ability to do so via audio recording. CMarks enables users to timestamp significant points of a presentation allowing them to review/listen to the points in time that they thought were noteworthy.
